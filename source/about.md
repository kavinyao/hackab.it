This is Jiawei "Kavin" Yao.

I'm currently a master student studying Computer Science at Stanford University.

I graduated from Software Institute, Nanjing University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree.

I love thinking, reading, programming and everything challenging and interesting.

This domain, hackab.it, as you can see, is a [domain hack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack "Domain Hack"). It reads "Hack a bit". The *bit* here is a pun as well.
